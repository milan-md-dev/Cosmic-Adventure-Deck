            "The party must assist the monk in preparing a meal that represents balance and restraint by:\n" +
            "1. Gathering ingredients from the local market, avoiding distractions like free samples of exotic snacks or pushy vendors.\n" +
            "2. Solving humorous food-related puzzles, such as deciphering a recipe written in an ancient dialect or figuring out how to repair a broken oven.\n" +
            "3. Managing the monk’s tendency to sneak bites of the dishes, requiring the party to stay vigilant.\n" +

            "The monk shares his gratitude with a satirical “blessing of balance,” offering the party a minor buff to charisma or luck.</string>
